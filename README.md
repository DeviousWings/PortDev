<h3>Purose</h3>

<p>The purpose of this site is to have a Library of Alexandria of Space Exploration. The technologies, the science,
    the theories and their timelines of discovery and lifetime. We will be going place to place to each space project
    to show what is being studied and the discoveries that they are making. Documenting what the top companies are
    doing for everyone to be able to not only enjoy space themselves, but how they are making us a space traveling
    species.
    <br>
    <br>
    We will also be exploring our own theories. This is also a Research and Development company. Along with
    documenting all the discoveries the big hats are making, we wish to do it ourselves. We will be building,
    studying, and creating our own image and ideas of what a space expletory spices might look like. Right now, we are
    just in the beginning phase of our projects to get them off the ground.
    <br>
    <br>
    We would also like to get you involved. Just like the rules in the Library of Alexandria, we will use the same
    rule. If you wish to take knowledge from our library, you must input some of your knowledge as well (do not worry,
    you are still able to see our content). But we want to get this in a global scale of study. Input your ideas so
    that they can be crossed examined and put into the library!
</p>

<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>This site is for all those who wish to read and understand the current happenings in the Space Industry. We hope
    to attract a lot of students, professor, curious people, and those who are just gazers out of hobby. News,
    theories, facts, and current studies that the major companies and science teams are currently doing. This will be
    the one stop shop for everything dealing with the Space Industry.
    <br>
    <br>
    As we are also a Research and Development team, we hope to attract those who wish to do research as well and
    develop more methods to be used by everyone to explore and discover. We invite all to participate in the
    discussions, theories, and studies we will be doing on this site.
    <br>
    <br>
    Having a website is great, but a goal we have is to make this library physical, and really, how do you wish to
    explore and the studies of space? On your computer or in real life. Once we get to a point, we will be creating an
    actual library of books of studies, theories, research and physical items like rockets, habitats, and future
    technologies that will progress our desires to explore and understand deep space.

 <h3>What you will find</h3>
        <p>The information that is necessary to complete any actions on this site will be all the data, no opinions
            (unless
            it is in a theories boards). As such, the greatest and most controversial topic is climate change. When you
            put
            in any data about the changing climate, you must also put the data “outside” the normal studies. Such as
            what
            was the sun doing, the electromagnetic galactic sheet, the magnetic field of the earth. This site will not
            blame
            humans or one chemical for the problems that arise, in such formats as climate change and the controversy
            from
            it. If you say the earth will flood, you must have the data to back that up. This is for research, this is
            for
            information, this is for understanding the world around us. Meaning if your information conflicts with the
            known, not the theory, rules of nature, (physics, biology, chemistry, etc.) it will be considered wrong and
            non-information. It will not be excepted on the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are a site of information, not opinion or “humans are the disease” type scenarios. We will seek only pure
            truth. Pure facts. Nothing less will suffice.
        </p>
        <p>
            We hope visitors will come to our site for the fact we will not play a bios, political game to get funding,
            affirm your opinions, or play to the dooms day of death. No altering information for you views. Until the
            information is cross examined by multiple sources, it will not be fact. It will be hard for information to
            be
            fact, but we do not want to have false information that causes nothing but strife. This will be the place
            where
            even those who do not study this field will be able to understand it. If a dooms day is every predicted on
            this
            site, it is because of the facts and pure truth of the data that was collected and studied. Until proven
            otherwise, everything is a theory and what is already known, and truth is already proven to be fact. You can
            study what is already known and add to the known, but that does not change the truth of the known or facts.
            Science is allowed to be questions. Time goes on and things will change.
        </p>
        <p>
            Earth, the Sun, Mars, and the cosmos is in an eternal change as time goes by, just like us humans are. We
            are
            the recorders of that change. The scribes of the cosmos. Understanding what we see around us to be better
            stewards and rulers of the world and cosmos. As we are a religious base minded researcher group, we believe
            science is not to push the boundaries of God, but to understand the boundaries set for us. To understand the
            stewardship He has granted us.
